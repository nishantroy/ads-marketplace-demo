# ads-marketplace-demo

Educational search-ads marketplace simulator: candidate generation, ranking,
second-price auctions, and budget pacing over a replayable six-hour session.

- [Engine specification](docs/engine-spec.md)
- [Project agent rules](AGENTS.md)

## Local setup

Requires Node 22+ and npm. The app listens on `127.0.0.1:3002` (registered in the parent port registry).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://127.0.0.1:3002
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit (run `npx next typegen` first on a fresh clone)
npm test             # vitest run
npm run lint
```

From the parent directory, `make run-ads-marketplace-demo` starts the app on its registered port.

Persistence (Neon Postgres) arrives in milestone M3; until then runs are held in server memory. Copy
`.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `DATABASE_URL` once M3 lands.

## How it works

The simulator replays a fixed six-hour session of search requests through an ads funnel and records
everything, so the browser can play the result back without recomputing anything.

1. **Scenario** (immutable input): users with a relevance score per category, campaigns with a category,
   objective (impression, click, or conversion), a max bid per impression and a session budget, and a
   pre-generated, timestamp-ordered stream of requests. The whole snapshot is hashed so runs can be compared.
2. **Funnel per request** (engine, runs server-side): retrieve campaigns in the request's category, drop
   any whose remaining budget is below the reserve, apply pacing admission, score the survivors and keep the
   top four above a fixed threshold, then run a single-slot second-price auction and charge the winner.
3. **Pacing** is the only switch between two comparable runs. With pacing on, a campaign is admitted only
   when its spend is behind a straight-line target for the elapsed session time.
4. **Outputs**: one full trace per request (every candidate and why it was excluded, bids, winner, price),
   72 five-minute timeline buckets, and a run summary. Revenue always equals total campaign spend.

Exact formulas, bounds and tie-breaking rules are in [docs/engine-spec.md](docs/engine-spec.md).

What exists today (after M0): the shared types, the score formulas, the stable hash used for pacing draws,
snapshot validation, and a tiny hand-calculable fixture with unit tests. The engine loop, seeded
marketplace, API, and playback UI arrive in later milestones.

## Layout

- `src/lib/contracts/` shared types: scenario, campaigns, users, requests, traces, run summary, timeline, API shapes.
- `src/lib/simulation/` pure engine code (no React, database, HTTP, or wall-clock).
- `src/lib/fixtures/` hand-calculable tiny scenario used by unit tests.
- `src/app/` Next.js app router pages and API routes.

Status: M0 complete (scaffold and frozen contracts). Engine, seeded marketplace, API, and playback UI follow.
